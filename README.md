### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Chances are if you're on this page, we work together! I've outlined my principles for work below (inspired by and stolen from an old coworker and friend, [@jssjr](https://github.com/jssjr)). 

---------------
### My Principles
#### Context over control

* I have a strong bias towards providing context vs controlling an outcome. This is a key ingredient in the recipe of â€œwork with smart people, and give them all the information they need to make a good decision. 
* One of my main roles is to provide you context about the direction of the company and the organization. 
* A lot of this will be through your manager and team updates. If you feel that you donâ€™t have the context you need, please tell me. 
* I will strive to give you the autonomy and context to make good decisions, and as part of that deal, I expect them to be pragmatic and business-oriented, and take into consideration technical and organizational impact. With autonomy comes a lot of responsibility to our stakeholders and co-workers. 
* We will occasionally change direction, and rarely weâ€™ll change quite rapidly. You might not always like this. I expect the maturity to disagree and commit.

#### Rigorous (but friendly) discussion is normal, and a sign of a healthy culture
* I view rigorous discussion as an artifact of doing important work. If the work didnâ€™t matter, no one would be engaged or have opinions. 
* Donâ€™t make things personal, donâ€™t take things personally.
* Have crucial conversations as soon as possible.


#### Feedback is served warm. Always.
* Withholding feedback is not meeting expectations. I am here to mentor, coach, and/or mediate in order to support you through giving feedback. 
* If youâ€™re unsure how to give someone feedback effectively, you should start by talking to your manager, then come to me if you need more help or perspective.
* I will support you and work through fallout from badly delivered or received feedback. 

#### Iâ€™m here to work for you, not the other way around!
* We all work for the company first.
* Communicating with me:
  * Unless previously communicated, I am always available and my calendar is always up to date
  * I prefer Slack for mostly-sync (I mute notifications outside of working hours)
  * I prefer documents or emails for vital communication and cross team accountability
  * Text or call me if it might be urgent. 24/7/365. You'll find my cell on my slack profile. 

* Communicating with you:
  * I donâ€™t have symmetrical expectations for communication in terms of availability or means of communication. 
  * I generally expect responses to be answered as soon as you have the information needed to reply and contribute meaningfully to the conversation. There is no expectation to preempt other work to respond to me. 
  * I will never text or phone you unless weâ€™re in an `omg the world is on fire` situation and youâ€™re the only person who can save us.
